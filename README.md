## Why?! :thinking: 

<aside> 

- **We take on the burden of interviewing**. Each candidate we find undergoes **5 rounds of interviews** before their final interview with you.

</aside>

<aside> 

- **You have no payroll or tax obligations.** You simply pay a recurring monthly fee per GrowthBuddy, for as long as the GrowthBuddy is assigned to you.

<aside>

- **There’s no retainer or success fee.** If you are unsatisfied with your GrowthBuddy’s performance, we find a replacement for no additional fee.

## How?! :woman_shrugging:

Before we shortlist a suitable candidate for the role, we conduct a role-specific 5-stage interview process to evaluate their suitability.

1. **Video screening** - We use this step to assess the candidate’s communication skills.
2. **Discovery call** - a short call to discuss their previous work experience in more detail, assess their verbal communication skills and understand what they want from their next opportunity.
3. **Pair programming** - A coding interview where we work through a problem with the candidate. This helps us assess their technical skills and their ability to work collaboratively.
4. **System design** - An interview to evaluate the candidate's problem-solving skills by analysing their approach to designing and architecting large-scale systems.
5. [Values fit interview](https://mygrowthbuddy.notion.site/Our-Values-2725962695794950b5a7e15a8520bf63) - a behavioural interview to assess if they’re likely to be a good cultural fit.
